# Responsive Login and Signup Form

A modern, responsive login and signup form designed to provide users with a streamlined experience in dark mode. This form features secure authentication options, social media login, and password visibility toggling, making it ideal for integrating into web applications that require user authentication.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a **responsive login and signup interface** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is designed with a focus on user experience and includes interactive elements such as password visibility toggling and social media login options (UI only). The dark mode aesthetic offers a visually appealing experience suitable for modern applications.

### Why These Technologies?
- **HTML & CSS**: For structure and styling, including dark mode.
- **JavaScript**: Handles form validation, error display, password toggling, and local storage for user credentials.
- **Boxicons**: Adds intuitive iconography to improve user interaction.

### Challenges & Future Enhancements
Some of the main challenges faced included creating a fully responsive layout that adjusts seamlessly across devices and ensuring secure validation for passwords. Future updates may include:
- Backend integration for social media logins.
- Email validation for stronger security.
- Reset password functionality.
